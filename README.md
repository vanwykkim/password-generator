## Description

This program is a password generator that can create random passwords

- Used a while loop to validate if the length of the password was a valid number between 8-128
- Used another while loop to validate that at least one character type was chosen for the password
- Used an array to hold the character type choices in boolean and checked to see if at least one was true to validate
- Concatinated an array of characters based on selection to include and used a randon number genarator to pic from the array
- Commented my code in Javascript
- Created a read.me
